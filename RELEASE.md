# XMC7000 and Traveo II GNU make Build System Release Notes
This repo provides the build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming XMC7000 and Traveo II applications. Builds can be run either through a command-line interface (CLI) or through the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox.

### What's Included?
This release of the XMC7000 and Traveo II GNU make build recipe includes complete support for building, programming, and debugging XMC7000 and Traveo II application projects. It is expected that a code example contains a top level make file for itself and references a Board Support Package (BSP) that defines specific items, like the XMC7000 or Traveo II part, for the target board. Supported functionality includes the following:

* Supported operations:
    * Build
    * Program
    * Debug
    * IDE Integration (Eclipse, VS Code, IAR, uVision)
* Supported toolchains:
    * GCC
    * IAR
    * ARM Compiler 6

### What Changed?
#### v1.2.0
* Improved stability and bug fixes.

#### v1.1.1
* Added support for BSP_PROGRAM_INTERFACE to select debug interface. Valid values are "KitProg3" and "JLink". Default value is "KitProg3".
* Eclipse and VSCode export will now only generate the launch configuration for the selected programming interface.

#### v1.0.0
* Initial release

### Product/Asset Specific Instructions
Builds require that the ModusToolbox tools be installed on your machine. This comes with the ModusToolbox install. On Windows machines, it is recommended that CLI builds be executed using the Cygwin.bat located in ModusToolBox/tools\_x.y/modus-shell install directory. This guarantees a consistent shell environment for your builds.

To list the build options, run the "help" target by typing "make help" in CLI. For a verbose documentation on a specific subject type "make help CY\_HELP={variable/target}", where "variable" or "target" is one of the listed make variables or targets.
